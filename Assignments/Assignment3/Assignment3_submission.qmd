# Assignment goal
The goal of this project is to implement a simple model of almond (any crop) yield anomaly response to climate.

The inputs will be daily times series of minimum, maximum daily temperatures and precipitation.

The outputs will be maximum, minimum and mean yield anomaly for an input time series.

# Background

Lobell et al., 2006 used data to build models of tree crop yield for California that captured how
climate variation (place and time) might influence yield. This paper will be the source for the transfer function that will be used in the model.

# Setup

```{r}
clim_raw <- read.table("Assignments/Assignment3/data/clim.txt")

colnames(clim_raw) <- as.character(clim_raw[1,])
clim_raw <- clim_raw[-1,]
```
